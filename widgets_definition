widgets?

click opens modal. Write an inline hidden div. on clicking a link, call whatever. Simple Dialog for mobile, reveal for web. Or can simple dialog handle both?

What about touch events and code? Other hooks. I'll have to write a way of including them. And then add that to DOM. Don't forget to unbind these.

so what widgets do we have?


0)Widgets
-min-height, min-width, max-height, max-width
-Modal on click
-events for onLoad, onDisplay, onClick and other event binding
-Styling defaults


1) An image widget that
-zooms to fullscreen on touch/click
-has innovative labels. (Relatively Positioned on modal boxes? CSS?)
---Second thoughts, who the fuck would ue that? Images would come with labels already, who'll scrub them?
